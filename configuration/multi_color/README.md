# Multi-color tracking with ensemble

See jupyter notebook in ultrack's repo for demonstration of multi-color tracking without a multi-color segmentation model, URL: https://github.com/royerlab/ultrack/blob/main/examples/multi_color_ensemble/multi_color_ensemble.ipynb

Two conda environments configurations are provided, a [CPU only](https://github.com/royerlab/ultrack/blob/main/examples/multi_color_ensemble/environment_cpu.yml) and [GPU accelerated](https://github.com/royerlab/ultrack/blob/main/examples/multi_color_ensemble/environment_gpu.yml).
