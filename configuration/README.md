# Configuration index

This file and its subdirectories organize the setup and execution configuration of Ultrack's experiments.

Our goal here is to describe how to show the pipeline executed in our experiments, so any user can easily modify them for their own applications.
It's not our goal to fully reproduce the experiments as most of them are entangled with the data and the environment in which they were executed.

The experiments being, using our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.02.610652) as a reference:
