# Figures scripts

This directory contains scripts to generate figures and some videos for the paper.

The goal of this directory is to share the scripts we used to generate the content of the paper's figures.

This does not mean that all the figures were generated by python scripts, most of them were created using a combination of python scripts to generate images, R and Python to create plots and Affinity Designer to organize and finalize the figures.

Non-goal, a fully reproducible pipeline for each figure. Most the data pointed to our internal infrastructure and have been anonymized. Our intentation with the scripts were to have a quick deterministic figure generation process, therefore code is not always optimized for performance or readability.
